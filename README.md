# Obsidian
My knowledge base

Context:
- [KnowledgeBase](KnowledgeBase.md)

The Knowledge base structure:

- Base - contains all notes. I don't use subfolders at all because I organize the notes structure using Obsidian links.
- Daily - contains daily notes where I collect to-do lists and other information.
- Files - contains files that I add to notes (images, PDFs, etc.).
- Templates - contains templates that I apply to notes to quickly add a special structure.


Tags:

#todo - task that I need to do
#fixme - note should be fixed
#unlinked - note should be linked to parent note
